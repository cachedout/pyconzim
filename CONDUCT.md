Code of Conduct
===============


Our community is welcoming and kind.

To participate here, please treat other people
like you would want to be treated. Show kindness
and respect for others and their ideas and work
together.

Please do not use strong language or harass others
in any way.

Do not make others feel unwelcome because of their
ethnicity or gender or for any other reason.

If you do any of these things, even as a joke,
you will be asked to leave.

Thanks!
